Complete Login Flow in Spring Security
1. Client Request
User Submits Credentials: The user enters their credentials (username and password) into a login form and submits it to the server.
2. Security Filter Chain
Request Interception: The request is intercepted by the Spring Security filter chain, which includes several filters responsible for different aspects of security.
3. Authentication Filter
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter: This filter is responsible for handling form-based login requests. It processes the login form submission, extracting the username and password from the request. It then creates a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken with these credentials. Initially, this token is in an unauthenticated state (i.e., authenticated property is false).
4. Authentication Token Creation
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken: This is a concrete implementation of the Authentication interface. It holds the credentials provided by the user (username and password). At this point in the flow, the token represents the user’s request for authentication but does not yet indicate whether authentication was successful.
5. Authentication Manager
Delegation to AuthenticationManager: The UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken is passed to the AuthenticationManager for processing. The AuthenticationManager is responsible for delegating the authentication request to one or more AuthenticationProvider implementations.
6. Authentication Provider
DaoAuthenticationProvider: The AuthenticationManager typically uses a DaoAuthenticationProvider for handling username and password authentication. The DaoAuthenticationProvider performs the following steps:
UserDetailsService: The DaoAuthenticationProvider uses a UserDetailsService to load user-specific data based on the provided username. It retrieves a UserDetails object that contains information about the user, including their credentials (password) and authorities (roles).
Password Comparison: The DaoAuthenticationProvider compares the provided password with the stored password using a PasswordEncoder. If the passwords match, the provider creates a fully authenticated UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken (or another Authentication implementation) with the user’s details.
7. Authentication Result
Successful Authentication: If the credentials are valid, the DaoAuthenticationProvider returns an authenticated UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken to the AuthenticationManager. This token is then stored in the SecurityContext (via SecurityContextHolder), indicating that the user is authenticated.

Failed Authentication: If the credentials are invalid, the DaoAuthenticationProvider throws an AuthenticationException. The authentication filter catches this exception and handles it, typically by redirecting the user back to the login page with an error message.

8. Security Context
Storing Authentication: On successful authentication, the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken (now authenticated) is stored in the SecurityContext. This context is used to maintain the authentication information throughout the user's session and to make authorization decisions.
9. Access Decision
Authorization: When the user attempts to access protected resources, the application uses the information stored in the SecurityContext to determine whether the user has the necessary permissions. This is done by checking the user's roles and authorities.
10. Response Handling
Handling the Response: Based on the outcome of the authentication and authorization process, the server responds to the client. If authentication was successful, the user might be redirected to a secured page or dashboard. If authentication failed, the user is typically redirected back to the login page with an error message.
Summary of Key Components
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter: Extracts the username and password from the login form and creates a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.

UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken: Represents the authentication request containing user credentials and is passed to the AuthenticationManager.

AuthenticationManager: Uses an AuthenticationProvider (such as DaoAuthenticationProvider) to process the authentication request.

DaoAuthenticationProvider: Validates the credentials against a UserDetailsService and performs password comparison. It returns a fully authenticated UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken if the credentials are correct.
